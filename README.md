# Group 45 - Bike Sharing Data Analysis

- Your title can change over time.

## Milestone 1 - Form Team and Find Dataset

In this milestone you will be expected to choose a dataset appropriate for the DATA 301 project. The most important task for this milestone is to select an appropriate dataset.

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I wanted to choose this dataset because bike sharing used to be a very popular topic, especially in China, and it used to be a way for many people to get around, even those who had cars.
My personal interest is in the analysis of bike-sharing user demographics. My analysis may include whether these two types of users( casual and registered) share the same user number trends, as well as the analysis of the characteristics of each of them and the percentage of total users. I am taking a statistics course this term, which has inspired me, and I think I can use some statistical skills to accomplish this task.

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.



## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset I analyze is the bike-sharing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It records the hourly and daily data of the numbers of bike rentals in Washington, DC between 2011 and 2012. The dataset was created by Dr. Hadi (Fanaee-T 2013) from the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD), at the (UCI Machine Learning Repository 2017) and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset).

My dataset consists of two raw csv files, both of which record bike share usage in Washington DC for a two-year period from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012. It mainly includes the temperature, humidity, and wind speed records of each day, as well as the two types of users who use shared bicycles on that day: the number of casual and registered users and the total number of the two types of users. In addition, day and hour csv file respectively record which day of the week and What time of day it was.
